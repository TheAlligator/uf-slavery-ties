              <p>Gabriella Paul flipped through notes she had written as a UF student in 2018. One in particular caught her attention: “UF ties to slavery?”</p>
              <p>Paul, a UF journalism alumna, never imagined that one-inch note would turn into a research project uncovering UF’s expansive history with slavery, she said.</p>
              <p>“I think that it is a testament to what a few people can do when they care about justice,” Paul said. “If we can do something even as little as discovering what that history is and see it continue to live on, it would be the proudest moment I would have looking at my alma mater.”</p>
              <p>UF Student Government passed <a href="https://sg.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-2028-Student-Body-Resolution.pdf" target="_blank">a resolution, or a declaration of opinion,</a> June 2 that asks the university to investigate its history. The resolution fostered a movement of almost 45 sponsors of the bill, or people who signed in support, including history professors, student organizations such as the Indigenous American Student Association and SG senators.</p>
              <p>However, the research began over a year before the resolution passed. It began in Fall 2018, when Paul wrote a research paper for a special topics class headed by Jon Sensbach, a UF professor of history. The paper was about how other schools were researching their ties to slavery and what they did to reconcile with their past, Paul said.</p>
              <p>In Spring 2019, Sensbach asked Paul and three other students to work in an independent study to look into UF’s history with slavery. At the end of their study, they had created a 50-page report named “Slavery and the University of Florida: African Americans, Seminoles and the Origins of Higher Education in Florida” that was published physically in Smathers.  The report examined slavery and the removal of indiginous people spanning from 1853 to 1866.</p>
              <p>They found that <a href="http://www.library.ufl.edu/spec/archome/Series164.htm" target="_blank">East Florida Seminary</a> in Ocala, which moved to Gainesville in 1866 and merged with three other schools in 1905 to become the University of Florida, was built by proceeds from the sale of former Seminole Native American land, Paul said.</p>
              <p>Land that was seized by the <a href="https://myfloridahistory.org/date-in-history/august-04-1842/armed-occupation-act#:~:text=1842%20%2D%20The%20Armed%20Occupation%20Act,rations%20from%20the%20Federal%20government." target="_blank">Armed Occupation Act of 1842</a>, which encouraged any person who could defend the land to forcefully take it, was sold to create the Seminary Land Fund, which was used to build the East Florida Seminary, said Adreanne Martinez, a Spring 2020 UF graduate who co-authored the resolution to look into UF’s history.</p>
              <p>They also found that members of the Board of Trustees in the 1850s collectively owned 219 slaves during that time. And the families on the East Florida Seminary’s commencement ceremony list in 1861 owned a total of 197 slaves, Martinez said.</p>
              <p>Their biggest barrier in research was the lack of records, Paul said. They mainly worked in Smathers Library, and they went to the State Library and Archives of Florida in Tallahassee to look at census records, she said.</p>
              <p>They found firsthand accounts of people living during the 1800s and one written record of a commencement ceremony held by East Florida Seminary. Then, they cross examined the names from those documents with census and slave records from that time, Paul said.</p>

              <p>Although Martinez, a UF political science and history alumna, was not involved with the original research done in Spring 2019, she advanced the movement to study UF’s history by co-writing an SG resolution that suggested UF acknowledge its past by researching it further, she said.</p>
              <p>Martinez started working on the project for her senior thesis for history. She also looked into UF’s history with slavery, relying mostly on Paul’s research, and examined how other schools, such as Harvard University, Georgetown University and Clemson University, recognized and reconciled their histories in slavery, she said.</p>
              <p>During her studies, Martinez noticed that UF hadn’t done anything to recognize its history. And she realized no one had fully investigated or reported it either, she said.</p>
              <p>Students were the driving force behind institutional change in the schools that Martinez researched because they were the ones starting the research into the school’s history and pushing for the research to be done, she said. So when she noticed the gap in UF’s history, she decided to initiate change, too.</p>
              <p>The SG resolution that Martinez co-wrote asks the university to assemble a working group of students and faculty to further research UF’s history with slavery and Native American removal, she said.</p>
              <p>The resolution also requests the creation of university-level curriculum and courses on the topic, where students and faculty can research UF’s history for the class, she said.</p>
              <p>Martinez had been trying to get the resolution passed since April, she said. But she had difficulty getting it into the Senate chamber for a vote.</p>
              <p>It was postponed twice and then failed by the Judiciary Committee, a group of senators who decide what non-budget legislation goes to Senate to be voted on. </p>
              <p>But when a co-author of the resolution, Senator Claudia Tio (Independent, District C), added it to the agenda and called for a vote, the resolution passed unanimously June 2.</p>
              <p>Judiciary Chair Seth Longland wrote in an email to The Alligator June 1 that the Judiciary Committee initially failed the resolution because they determined it overstepped the Senate’s powers. He said he was concerned about Senate “not having the authority to order higher level administration to create a work group.”</p>
              <p>However, during the same meeting, the committee <a href="https://sg.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Student-Senate-Bill-2020-1025.pdf" target="_blank">passed a different resolution</a> that asked UF administration to adopt a food purchasing program that encourages buying local food.</p>
              <p>He wrote in an email to The Alligator two days later that the Judiciary Committee never intended to fail the bill because it overstepped the Senate’s powers. But when they postponed it for a third time, it <a href="https://sg.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/000-Rules-and-Procedures-Amended-Summer-2019-1.pdf" target="_blank">failed due to Senate rules.</a></p>
              <p>Eight out of nine of the Judiciary Committee members were present at the meeting when it finally passed in Senate, but no one objected when it was voted on. None of the Judiciary Committee members present for the vote answered questions from The Alligator asking why they passed the bill just three days after failing it.</p>
              <p>The <a href="https://oral.history.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">Samuel Proctor Oral History Program</a>, which conducts oral interviews with people to preserve and promote history, will be part of future research. The program is directed by UF history professor Paul Ortiz, and it will let researchers use its more than 1,000 oral history interviews with Native American people of the Southeast and more than 1,000 with African American elders in their studies.</p>
              <p>UF has ignored the impact of slavery and genocide of Native Americans for too long, Ortiz said. By ignoring this history, people grow more frustrated. People cannot move forward until they acknowledge the past, he said.</p>

              <p>Other universities, like Georgetown University, are ahead of UF because they’ve started researching, Ortiz said. UF should be taking the lead on this initiative instead.</p>
              <p>“Can we really realistically talk about having an equitable society or having a democratic society if we continue to hide the truth that that society is built upon?” Ortiz asked. “My hope is that we bring out the full story, we learn from it and we shake hands together.”</p>
              <p>Confronting this history can be difficult, Martinez said, but it is necessary if schools want to be more diverse and inclusive. The legacies of slavery and Jim Crow segregation still affect society, she said, and the death of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and other black people have shed a light on inequality today.</p>
              <p>“I’m hoping that it brings more diversity and inclusivity in the present, but I definitely think it's going to bring more diversity and inclusivity in the past as well,” she said. “We’re adding this history that's kind of been kept quiet for so long.”</p>
